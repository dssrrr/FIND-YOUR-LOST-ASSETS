# FIND-YOUR-LOST-ASSETS

The The idea behind this project is to develop a web based application which provides facility for students/faculty to find their lost things in the college
premises. If anyone finds something in the college premises, they can just open our website and take a picture of the item and upload the picture
along with its details and submit the item to admin. The person who lost the item will just access the website and search if item was found on website
and can collect from admin providing valid ID.
